# DiscordClone

This application should be a backend for a discord clone, maybe in the future this will probably turn into something different from a discord clone.

Documentation will be one of the next things I will do.

This is a WIP.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
